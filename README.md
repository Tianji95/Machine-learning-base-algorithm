# Machine-learning-base-algorithm
some basic algorithm in machine learning including bayes decision ruleï¼Œ gaussian discriminant perceptron, regression, svm, knn, kmeans, neural networks,pca

This project is a homework of machine learning course in Zhejiang University.There are four homework in this project.

**In the first homework: hw1**

We implement the algorithm of Bayes decision rule, the gaussian discriminant and the text classification using posterior and likelihood
we got some result using MLE-maximum likelihood estimation.

**In the hw2**

We implement some linear models including linear_regression, logistic regression, perceptron and svm.
we also show the cross validation of these algorithms.

this is the result of the svm.

**In the hw3**

We implement KNN, k-means and neural networks including feedforward and backprop algorithm.
and there is also a tool written in python to get some verification code image from Zhejiang University website.

this is the result of knn, when k==10.

**In the hw4**

We write some code to implement Spectral Clustering and pca

this is the result of Sepctral Clustering, when knn_graph==4.
