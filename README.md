# Machine-learning-base-algorithm
some basic algorithm in machine learning including bayes decision ruleï¼Œ gaussian discriminant perceptron, regression, svm, knn, kmeans, neural networks,pca

This project is a homework of machine learning course in Zhejiang University.There are four homework in this project.

In the first homework, we implement the algorithm of Bayes decision rule, the gaussian discriminant and the text classification using posterior and likelihood
we got some result using MLE(maximum likelihood estimation)
